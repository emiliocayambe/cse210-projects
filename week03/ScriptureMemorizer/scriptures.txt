Proverbs | 3 | 5 | 6 | Trust in the Lord with all time heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding; In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
1 Nephi | 19 | 9 |And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men.
